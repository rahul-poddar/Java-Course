# Data Types in Java
In Java, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. Java has two categories of data types: `Primitive` and `Non-primitive` (also known as reference types).

## Primitive Data Types
Java has eight primitive data types:

**byte :** *8-bit signed integer. Range:-* `128 to 127`.\
**short :** *16-bit signed integer. Range:-* `32,768 to 32,767`.\
**int :** *32-bit signed integer. Range:-* `2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647`.\
**long :** *64-bit signed integer. Range:-* `9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807`.\
**float :** *32-bit floating-point number.*\
**double :** *64-bit floating-point number.*\
**char :** *16-bit Unicode character.*\
**boolean :** *true/false value.*

## Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types in Java are also known as reference types. They are used to refer to objects, and they include:

Classes\
Interfaces\
Arrays

## Conclusion
Understanding data types is essential in Java programming. By choosing the appropriate data type for a variable, you can ensure that your program is efficient and effective. The eight primitive data types and non-primitive (reference) data types in Java provide a wide range of options for storing and manipulating data in your programs.
