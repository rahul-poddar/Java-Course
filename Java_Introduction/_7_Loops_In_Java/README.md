# Loop Statements 
Loop statements in Java are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true or until a certain condition is met. Java has three types of loop statements: `for loop`, `while loop`, and `do-while loop`.

## For Loop
A for loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times. The syntax of a for loop in Java is as follows:

> for (initialization; condition; update) {\
>     // code block to be executed\
> }

Here, `initialization` is the initial value of the loop counter, `condition` is the condition that must be true for the loop to continue, and `update` is the operation that is performed on the loop counter after each iteration of the loop.

## While Loop
A while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. The syntax of a while loop in Java is as follows:

> while (condition) {\
>     // code block to be executed\
> }

Here, `condition` is the condition that must be true for the loop to continue.

## Do-While Loop
A do-while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. The syntax of a do-while loop in Java is as follows:

> do {\
>     // code block to be executed\
> } while (condition);

Here, the code block is executed first, and then the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the code block is executed again. This process continues until the condition is false.
