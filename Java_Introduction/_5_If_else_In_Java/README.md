# If-Else Statements
If-else statements are fundamental constructs in programming that allow a program to make decisions based on certain conditions. The if-else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.

## Nested If-Else Statements
Nested if-else statements are used when multiple conditions need to be evaluated. In this case, an if statement is placed inside another if or else block.
