# Strings in Java
This repository contains examples and exercises related to working with strings in Java.

## Introduction
Strings in Java are objects that represent a sequence of characters. They are widely used in Java programming for a variety of tasks, such as printing text, storing user input, and manipulating data. In Java, strings are immutable, which means that once a string object is created, its contents cannot be changed. This makes them useful for operations that do not require frequent modifications to the string.
