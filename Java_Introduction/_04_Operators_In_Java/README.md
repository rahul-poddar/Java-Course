# Operators in Java
Operators in Java are special symbols that perform operations on one or more operands. They are an essential part of the Java programming language and provide a concise way to write complex operations. In this readme, we will cover the most common operators in Java.

## Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on numeric values. The most common arithmetic operators in Java are:

+ **+ (addition) :** Adds two values.
+ **- (subtraction) :** Subtracts the second value from the first value.
+ ***(multiplication) :** Multiplies two values.
+ **/ (division) :** Divides the first value by the second value.
+ **% (modulus) :** Returns the remainder of the division operation.

## Relational Operators
Relational operators are used to compare two values. The result of a relational operation is a boolean value `(true or false)`. The most common relational operators in Java are:

+ **== (equal to) :** Returns true if the two values are equal.
+ **!= (not equal to) :** Returns true if the two values are not equal.
+ **> (greater than) :** Returns true if the first value is greater than the second value.
+ **< (less than) :** Returns true if the first value is less than the second value.
+ **>= (greater than or equal to) :** Returns true if the first value is greater than or equal to the second value.
+ **<= (less than or equal to) :** Returns true if the first value is less than or equal to the second value.

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine boolean values. The result of a logical operation is a boolean value `(true or false)`. The most common logical operators in Java are:

+ **&& (logical AND) :** Returns true if both boolean values are true.
+ **|| (logical OR) :** Returns true if at least one boolean value is true.
+ **! (logical NOT) :** Returns the opposite boolean value (true becomes false and false becomes true).

## Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The most common assignment operators in Java are:

+ **= (assignment operator) :** Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
+ **+= (addition assignment) :** Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the result.
+ **-= (subtraction assignment) :** Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the result.
+ ***= (multiplication assignment) :** Multiplies the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result.
+ **/= (division assignment) :** Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result.
+ **%= (modulus assignment) :** Computes the modulus of the variable on the left and the value on the right, and assigns the result to the variable on the left.

## Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. The most common bitwise operators in Java are:

+ **& (bitwise AND) :** Performs a bitwise AND operation on two values.
+ **| (bitwise OR) :** Performs a bitwise OR operation on two values.
+ **^ (bitwise XOR) :** Performs a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation on two values.
+ **~ (bitwise NOT) :** Flips the bits of a value (i.e., 0s become 1s and 1s become 0s).
+ **<< (left shift) :** Shifts the bits of a value to the left by a specified number of positions.
+ **>> (right shift) :** Shifts the bits of a value to the right by a specified number of positions, filling the leftmost positions with the sign bit.
+ **>>> (unsigned right shift) :** Shifts the bits of a value to the right by a specified number of positions, filling the leftmost positions with 0s.

## Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It has the following syntax:
`variable = condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;`
