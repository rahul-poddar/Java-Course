# Variables in Java
In Java, a variable is a container that holds a value of a specific data type. Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated or used in a program. In this readme, we will cover the basics of variables in Java.

## Declaring Variables
To declare a variable in Java, you must specify the variable's data type and name. Here's an example of declaring an integer variable called "number":
`int number;`

In this example, "int" is the data type, and "number" is the variable name. You can also declare multiple variables of the same data type on the same line, separated by commas:
`int num1, num2, num3;`

## Initializing Variables
After declaring a variable, you can initialize it by assigning a value to it. Here's an example of initializing the "number" variable:
`number = 10;`

You can also declare and initialize a variable on the same line:
`int number = 10;`

## Naming Variables
When naming variables in Java, there are a few rules you must follow:

The variable name must start with a letter or underscore character.\
The variable name cannot start with a number.\
The variable name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.\
Java is case sensitive, so `"number"` and `"Number"` are considered different variable names.\
It's also good practice to use descriptive names for your variables to make your code more readable and understandable.

## Conclusion
Variables are an essential part of Java programming. They allow you to store and manipulate data in your program. By following the rules for declaring and initializing variables, you can create efficient and effective programs.
