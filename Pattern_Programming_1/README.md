## Pattern Programming
Pattern programming is a type of programming that involves creating various patterns using loops and conditional statements in a programming language. The resulting patterns can be visually pleasing and have practical applications in fields such as graphic design, textile design, and data visualization.

## Getting Started
To get started with pattern programming, you will need to have a programming language installed on your computer. Some popular languages for pattern programming include Python, Java, and C++. You will also need a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write your code.


Pattern programming is a fun and creative way to explore the capabilities of programming languages. By combining loops and conditional statements, you can create visually appealing patterns that have practical applications in a variety of fields. With some practice and experimentation, you can create your own unique patterns and explore the possibilities of pattern programming.
